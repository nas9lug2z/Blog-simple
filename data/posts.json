    ▫️▫️Rethymno & Heraklion▫️▫️
    ◻️◻️Things to do:◻️◻️
    ⬜️ eat pita gyros and Greek salad (don't pay more than 4€ per dish, go a bit further from the main touristic squares to get the same quality for less money)
    ⬜️ have a walk to the fortress in Heraklion (Venice Harbour) on the sunset
    ⬜️ check opening hours and prices for main attractions. Today is the Holy Saturday, so Knossos palace closed at 15:00 (instead of 18:00 normally), prices we found on some web page were out of date (5€ instead of 15€ in reality)
    ⬜️also check opening hours for big supermarkets, we went to Lidl too late, it was closed already at 19.00, and any of the big supermarkets will be opened until Tuesday. There are some small local mini/supermarkets, but they don't offer big variety and quality of products
    ⬜️ have a walk in the souvenirs shop street in Rethymno, check out their famous silver with enamel ⬜️ bring with you a suncream and an after sun gel from home. It turned out they don't sell it on every corner (like in most touristic places), and even in a supermarket they didn't have any! Pharmacies (99% of which were closed already after 14:00) have them. However, prices in all places are crazy (even in pharmacy 200ml Nivea(!) after sun was 14€). The cheapest option we got was 7€ for 150ml. Sun protection we still haven't found, so tomorrow, on Easter Sunday, we will have a lot of fun looking for it 😄",
